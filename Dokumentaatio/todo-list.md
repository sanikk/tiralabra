- Own heap for Djikstra
(why on earth? like my implementation is going to be better? =D)

- Implement IDA*

- Do a proper GUI

- Tests for everything

- Do many more different Graphs for testing and demo purposes

- Categorize the afore-mentioned graphs a bit to get a feel on the differences in performance

- forgot this one while filling out the one before this. **Lunch!**

- do a proper project_specification.md, last one sucked
